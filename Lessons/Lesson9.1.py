# Instructions
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary.
# The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program,
# you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for
# keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
#
# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.
#
# This is the scoring criteria:
#
# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
